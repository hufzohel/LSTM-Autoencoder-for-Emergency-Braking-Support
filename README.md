# LSTM-Autoencoder-for-Emergency-Braking-Support
A project for [CO3101 - ĐATH | HCMUT] 
## Overview
The project aim to solve or reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by human-error especially mistaking the gas-pedal for the brake-pedal by implementing LSTM autoencoder using Tensorflow. 
* Autoencoder: a neural network designed to learn compressed representations of data.
* LSTM: a type of RNN aimed at mitigating vanishing gradient.
By combining them, the model can capture temporal patterns in sequential data.
## Objectives
* Understand the architecture of LSTM Autoencoders
* Apply the model to sequential data: brake pedal position, gas pedal position, vehicle speed
* Evaluate and spot contradiction in data to support braking.
## Tech Stack
* Language: Python
* Libraries: Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas.
* Tools: Google Colab, Github Projects
